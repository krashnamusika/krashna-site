choir:
  title: Choir
  text: >
    The Krashna choir is a group of about 50 enthusiastic singers. We come together every Wednesday night in order to work a diverse repertoire of classical music and our own singing skills. There is no audition for the choir, so we are looking for both experienced and starting singers. Every year the choir does two or three big projects. By varying the repertoire as much as possible, there is always a new challenge both in studying new notes and mastering a new form of expression. Guided by our capable choir conductor, even the less-experienced singers will be able to sing comfortably, while the choir maintains a high quality of sound. The choir recently sang Fauré’s Requiem, Magnificat by Rutter, Kytice by Martinu, Messa di Gloria by Puccini. Additionally, the choir has performed beautiful a-Capella pieces like the Requiem of Daily.

orchestra:
  title: Orchestra
  text: >
    The orchestra of 'Delfts Studenten Muziek Gezelschap' Krashna Musika currently has approximatly 60 members. It has an occupation of a standard symphony orchestra with which high quality music is performed. The repertoire usually consists of great classical works, but there is room for more modern works. Recent examples are 'Tod und Verklärung' by R. Strauss, 'Isle of the dead' by Rachmaninoff, the 5th symphony by Shostakovich, and Mahler's 'Das Lied von der Erde'. Krashna gives two concert series every year where both the choir and the orchestra perform. The choir piece is then usually also accompanied by the orchestra (usually in a smaller setting). Pieces that have recently been performed with the choir are the Mozart Requiem, 'Kytice' by Martinu and 'Messa di Gloria' by Puccini.

      Our choir conductor: Ruben de Grauw
    text: |
      Ruben de Grauw (1980) started singing at a very young age. When he was 7, he joined the Sacramentskoor in Breda. When he was 16, he started his own choir: 'Jeugdkamerkoor Plurale Tantum', for young singers between 15 and 25 years of age. After conducting this choir for eighteen years, he left the choir in 2015. Ruben studied Choir conducting from Wiecher Mandemaker at the Conservatory of Rotterdam. In 2004 he followed up his Bachelor degree with a Master of Music from Louis Buskens at Fontys Conservatory in Tilburg. Between 2009 and 2013 Ruben was assistant-conductor at the 'Nederlands Studenten kamerkoor' and he is currently the conductor of the project choir Cappella Ex Occasione in Breda, and naturally the student choir of Krashna Musika in Delft. Recently Ruben became consultant of amateur art at the foundation Nieuwe Veste in Breda. Ruben is still active as a singer. He is a tenor at the Laurens Collegium in Rotterdam and Studium Chorale in Maastricht.

      We are very happy to say that Ruben has been leading Krashna's choir since November 2011.

      Our orchestra conductor: Stijn Berkouwer
    text: |
      Stijn has given concerts with the Nederlands Philharmonisch Orkest, the Gelders Orkest, the Noord Nederlands Orkest, Opera Zuid and Opera Lab Barlin and will soon make his début at the Orkest van het Oosten. Stijn Berkouwer also works with amateur- and student orchestras on a regular basis, since 2019 he is the chief-conductor of Symphony orchestra De Philharmonie.
      Besides that he was assistant-conductor for Ivan Fischer, Simon Rattle, the Concertgebouworkest, the Konzerthausorchester Berlin, the NJO and the Nederlandse Reisopera.

      Stijn will be the conductor of the Krashna Musika orchestra from March 2019.
chamber-music:
  title: Chamber Music
  text: |
    Next to the choir and orchestra, Krashna knows a third department: the chamber music department. This department is unique for student music associations in the Netherlands. Chamber music members get the opportunity to form ensembles to perform their own chosen music on the chamber music concerts. The ensembles are diverse with respect to their level, repertoire and setting. Soloist are also allowed to perform.

    There are about six chamber music concerts each year and they are open to all public. Furthermore, Krashna organises lunch concerts in some of the faculties of the TU Delft each year, where employees and students of that faculty are also invited to perform. Finally, there is a masterclass each year where Krashna ensembles are coached by professional chamber musicians. These masterclasses are also open to public.

chamber-choir:
  title: Chamber Choir
  text: |
    The Krashna Chamber Choir is a small group of about 16 singers who also sing in the Krashna Choir. Since the rehearsal tempo of the chamber choir is higher than that of the choir, the members of the chamber choir are expected to prepare their own parts at home.  As a consequence, the chamber choir can invest a lot of time in developing the quality of sound during the rehearsals.

    Every project of the chamber choir features classical pieces from many musical periods and composers. Depending on the theme of the project, it could happen that the repertoire includes pieces of both Tichely and Morley. In contrast to the choir and the orchestra, the chamber choirs aims to have a different conductor for every concert. Consequently, every project will sound different, corresponding to the interpretation of a different conductor.

chamber-orchestra:
  title: Chamber Orchestra
  text: |
    Orchestra members regularly organise chamber orchestra projects as well. With KrashKO (Krashna Chamber Orchestra), members play in a smaller orchestra conducted by varying (young) conductors. With challenging programs (from Beethoven to Poulenc), special children concerts (Peter and the Wolf) and a compact rehearsal schedule, these projects are always especially awesome.

    The last projects where in 2017 and 2018, conducted by Arndt Auhagen, a member of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. The programmes contained, amongst other works, Beethoven's 5th symphony and Stravinsky's Pulcinella Suite.

    **In the spring of 2020, there will be another edition of KrashKO!** See [the event page](/concerts/krashko-2020) for more information.

    ### Krashna what..?

    Krashna Musika! Or in other words: *‘Lovely Music’* ! Consisting of a symphony orchestra, a choir and several chamber music ensembles we are the student society for classical music in Delft. What do we have in common? That we enjoy playing beautiful music together. And that we like to have a good time!

    ### Concerts

    Each year, under the guidance of our two professional and enthusiastic [conductors](/conductors), we give at least two big concerts with the [symphonic orchestra](/orchestra) and the [choir](/choir). What we play varies from world-renowned pieces to unfamiliar diamonds in the world of classical music. In the past years for example we have performed works by Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich, Puccini, Fauré and Bach, but we have also surprised our audience with modern classical music such as a Czech ‘musical’ by Martinů and a wonderful requiem by Daley, which really gave everybody goose bumps. And let’s not forget: at our last lustrum we brought the opera Carmen by Bizet to live with musicians and actors in five virtually sold-out performances at the Auditorium of the TU Delft!

    Besides the symphonic orchestra and the choir we also have a chamber orchestra and a chamber choir. These offer our more advanced members the opportunity to rise to the challenge and  musically develop themselves even more. The chamber orchestra and the chamber choir have their own special concert programmes.

    Furthermore we organize chamber music evenings at [X](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/x/) and lunch concerts at the faculties of the TU Delft, where our members can perform self-selected pieces with music ensembles that they have created for the occasion. Additionally we sing Christmas carols at the always cozy ‘Lichtjesavond’ (‘evening of lights’) in Delft, we perform regularly at the Free Try Out evenings at [X](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/x/) and on occasion we perform in the streets to inspire people to attend our upcoming concerts.

    Last but not least: every other year we organize an international tour, in which we seize the opportunity to perform for an international audience and have a wonderful time abroad!

    ### Activities

    The symphonic orchestra and the choir have weekly rehearsals throughout the year (with the exception of holidays). In addition we have for each big concert a fun and intensive rehearsal weekend with everybody. One of these weekends takes place at a large farmers complex in the province of Noord-Brabant, were can go wild musically and in other ways, without being disturbed.

    Besides making music we love doing other fun things together. After the rehearsals we have drinks together, we often organize parties and every so often a formal ball, and once year we go on a sailing week together in the province of Friesland.

    Furthermore we of course have lots of fun [committees](/committees) in which our members take part, such as the committee for our magazine (the Krakra), the committee for selecting new repertoire (the RepCie), the Activities Committee, which organizes parties and other entertaining activities, and many other committees.

    Do you enjoy playing music and having fun with a lot of nice people?

    This summer, D.S.M.G. Krashna Musika will go on tour for a week to Vienna, Bratislava and Brno! On Friday July 6th, the choir and orchestra will travel to Bratislava by bus, where they will stay for the first three days. From there, they will continue their journey to Vienna and Brno. The repertoire consists of classical music, but is accessible to everyone. The tour will be concluded with a concert in Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ in Amsterdam.

  programme: |
    ### Concert program
    **Monday, 9 July:** evening concert in Slovak Radio Building in Bratislava\
    **Tuesday, 10 July:** concert at Schotten Kirche in Vienna\
    **Wednesday, 11 July:** afternoon concert in front of Church of St. Thomas in Brno\
    **Thursday, 12 July:** evening concert at Kuppelsaal in Vienna\
    **Sunday, 15 July:** afternoon concert at Muziekgebouw aan ’t IJ in Amsterdam (see [this page](/concerts/summer-amsterdam-2018) for more information).

    The admission for concerts in Bratislava, Vienna and Brno is free!

  repertoire: |
    ### Repertoire
    *The second symphony* by the Russian composer *Sergej Rachmaninov*, one of the most important composers and pianists of the 20st century. In 1908, the symphony was performed for the first time and received high praise. Ten months after the première, he received the Glinka award for this successful piece. The symphony is meant for a complete orchestra and consists of four parts, following the Russian symphonic tradition.

    *Mass On. 77 in B flat* by the Austrian composer *Johann Nepomuk Hummel*, although he was born in in Bratislava. He was the last representative of Viennese classical music and influenced the young composers of the romantic area. During his carrier, he was taught by Mozart, Haydn and Salieri. The effect of these classical Viennese influences can be heard in his symphony, which perfectly fits the destination of this lustrum tour.

  title: Orchestra conductor wanted for Krashna Musika

    ## About Krashna Musika

    The Delft Students Music Association (D.S.M.G.) Krashna Musika is the students classical music association of Delft, The Netherlands. The association consists of a symphony orchestra of around 90 members, a choir of around 50 members and a chamber music department of around 60 members.
    The orchestra is one of the leading Dutch student orchestras which has been performing large symphonic works. Examples of recent projects are Rachmaninoff’s Symphony No. 2, Concerto for Orchestra by Bartok and The Planets by Holst. Besides that there are also projects with soloists on a regular basis. The orchestra aims to a semi-professional level of music. Each year there are at least two programs rehearsed, mostly in cooperation with the choir, at which the orchestra plays a large symphonic work led by the orchestra-conductor and a choir work in a smaller orchestra setting led by the choir conductor (Ruben de Grauw).
    Krashna’s concerts mostly take place in churches in the Delft/Den Haag/Rotterdam region, but also tend to take place in the auditorium of the TU Delft and Muziekgebouw aan het IJ in Amsterdam. Next to that the orchestra and choir go on tour each two years, where they play/sing at special locations. This summer for example, the orchestra and choir went on tour to Bratislava, Brno and Vienna, whereas two years back they went sailing on tour through the waddeneilanden (group of small Dutch islands). For the last 37 years the orchestra of Krashna was directed by Daan Admiraal. With his passing last July, Krashna is looking for a new conductor for the orchestra.

    ## Job description

    Krashna Musika is looking for a conductor of the orchestra who conducts the orchestra from start to end each rehearsal. We rehearse every week on Monday evenings (from 19.30 till 22.30) and organise at least two concert series each year. Each project also comes with a rehearsal weekend. The conductor needs to be both musically and didactically versed. Since we work with amateurmusicians, it is important the conductor plays an active role in practicing the music with the orchestra, both technically and musically. We aim for a high musical level, but it also important the conductor is aware of the student character of the orchestra. Besides that a close cooperation with the choir conductor Ruben de Grauw is of utmost importance.

    The conductor is also a part of both the audition committee and the program committee. This means he/she is present at auditions for the orchestra and is actively involved in the choice of program, together with the program committee.

    This function is available starting at March 11th, when we start our new project for the concert serie in June. The program for this project has already been established. Appointment and payments are performed by the TU Delft.

    ## Qualifications

    - Has at least a Bachelor's degree in orchestra direction, or a provable similar level;
    - Experience with conducting (amateur)symphonic orchestras at a high level, both during rehearsals and concerts;
    - Broad knowledge of symphonic works, with an emphasis on (late)romantic and twentieth-century works;
    - Proven abilities in rehearsal and project planning;
    - Good commandment of the Dutch and/or English language;
    - Experience in working with soloists;
    - Experience in working with the target group (students and young adults) is an advantage.

    ## We offer

    - A permanent appointment at a good and enthusiastic student symphonic orchestra;
    - Concerts both at home and abroad;
    - The possibility to conduct large works from the symphonic repertoire.

    In Memoriam: Daan Admiraal
  body: |
    Much to our sorrow, our orchestra conductor, Daan Admiraal, passed away
    unexpectedly in his beloved Switzerland on July 22 at the age of 69. Daan was
    conductor of the Delft Student Music Association Krashna Musika for 37 years. From
    his appointment in 1981, when he, barely older than some of the musicians,
    came to stand in front of choir and orchestra, until his death, he has
    continuously worked to ensure that everyone performs to the best of their
    ability. Not only with passion and craftsmanship, but also with a healthy dose
    of stubbornness and a sometimes unparalleled sense of humor. At times,
    rehearsals needed to be interrupted, because he had unconsciously caused the
    entire orchestra to laugh their ass off, or consciously made it clear to
    everyone with a witty remark how the music should have sounded. Daan made sure
    never to place himself in front of the orchestra. Always at the service of the
    orchestra, he managed to enable the orchestra to convey the essence of many
    well-known and lesser-known 19th and 20th-century works to the public. It was
    only during the annual football match between the choir and the orchestra
    named after him that he managed to draw attention to himself by loudly
    encouraging us from the sidelines and urging us to leave the fingers of some
    essential instrumentalists intact.

    Krashna experienced many highlights over the years with Daan. Operas such as
    François Guyon and Carmen, symphonies by Mahler, the Sacre by Stravinsky.
    Daan led Krashna through it flawlessly, first as a peer, later as a father
    figure, always as a friend. Daan loved working with us and we loved working
    with him. Daan will be terribly missed by us and the many others he has
    inspired in his life, he will always live on in our music. For many
    instrumentalists the rehearsals on Monday were the highlight of the week,
    so on behalf of Krashna, in Daan's words:

    Daan, fijne vakantie! En tot maandag!

    Ter herinnering aan Rien Frölich
  body: |
    In de ochtend van 24 november 2021 is Krashna's erelid Rien Frölich overleden. Op 22 september was hij 90
    jaar geworden. Hij leed aan een ernstige kwaal, die lange tijd met steeds nieuwe medicatie onder controle
    gehouden kon worden. Eind september werd echter duidelijk dat er geen mogelijkheden meer waren.
    Negentig is een respectabele leeftijd, maar Rien was het liefst honderdveertig geworden. Zijn overlijden was
    niet openbaar bekend gemaakt, waardoor we het pas laat te weten zijn gekomen.

    Rien heeft in zijn leven heel veel verschillende dingen gedaan. Hij heeft altijd vele organisaties en
    (muziek)verenigingen gesteund. Hier willen we vooral zijn betrokkenheid bij en met Krashna belichten.

    Rien bezocht als recensent een concert van Krashna met het Requiem van Verdi onder leiding van Daan
    Admiraal in de Maria van Jessekerk (november 1990). Hij was muziekrecensent voor verschillende bladen;
    dit was zijn eerste kennismaking met Krashna Musika. Hij was zeer onder de indruk van het voor hem
    onverwachte hoge niveau van de uitvoering door "een studentenorkest". Hij is nooit de uitvoering van de
    "Concertante Goyescas" van Granados vergeten (december 1991): "Verbluffend. Kippenvel". Voor de opera
    Francois Guyon in 1996 ondersteunde hij in woord en daad de publicititeit: "tien uitverkochte concerten,
    tien prachtige uitvoeringen, ik had er niet een willen missen". De opera was speciaal voor Krashna
    gecomponeerd in het kader van het 750 jarig bestaan van de stad Delft door de componist Kees Olthuis.

    In 1993 werd Rien directeur van het Techniek Museum Delft (TMD), gevestigd in de voormalige
    machinehallen van de TU aan de Ezelsveldlaan. Hij zag potentie van de grote hal (voorheen de mensa) als
    concertlocatie en zorgde er voor dat er een mooie vleugel kwam. Toevallig konden rond die tijd de
    kamermuziekconcerten van Krashna niet meer in het Floratheater worden gegeven, omdat de bruikleen‐
    vleugel daar was weggehaald. Het bestuur van Krashna benaderde toen het Techniek Museum. Rien
    schreef: "We hoefden niet lang te praten. Van dat ogenblik af waren de kamermuziekconcerten van Krashna
    in het Techniek Museum. Al heel kort daarna, in datzelfde jaar 1993, vierde Krashna in het Techniek
    Museum haar 25‐jarig bestaan met een spetterend reunieconcert, met delen uit het Requiem van Mozart,
    de Polowetser dansen van Borodin en het Allegro voor vier Strijkkwartetten van Van Bree, gedirigeerd door
    erelid Maarten Surtel. Twee jaar lang hebben we enorm van elkaar genoten. In december 1995 nam
    Krashna toch afscheid van het TMD met een Oliebollenconcert".

    Rien stelde het Techniek Museum in 1995 precies op de 749ste verjaardag van de stad Delft open voor een
    voorproefje op de opera Francois Guyon met de componist aan de vleugel. Een voormalig bestuurslid van
    de Delftse Opera Compagnie vertelde dat van alle faciliteiten gebruik gemaakt kon worden om de
    gemeente en andere gasten in stijl te ontvangen.

    Van veel concerten in het Techniek Museum werden door Rien geluidsopnamen gemaakt. Hij had daar
    ervaring mee; hij had al diverse plaatopnamen op zijn naam staan (zoals voor het Erasmus label) en vele
    live‐opnamen (bijvoorbeeld van het Zenith Festival in de Paleiskerk Den Haag). Sinds 2008 hebben we met
    de KRAK soms apparatuur van hem kunnen lenen, als er specifieke aanvulling nodig was voor het opnemen
    van Krashna‐concerten.

    De kamermuziekconcerten verhuisden naar het nieuwe Cultureel Centrum van de TU. In dat Centrum gaf
    Rien overigens ook cursussen, onder andere over 'de opera', die natuurlijk ook door Krashna‐leden gevolgd
    werden.

    Ook bij de geënsceneerde Mattheuspassie in 1998 bleek Rien onmisbaar. Allerlei zaken als verlengsnoeren,
    stekkerdozen, een televisie en meer werden door hem aangesleept. Volgens de toenmalige voorzitter van
    Krashna "een echte redding".

    Door de jaren heen heeft Rien vele activiteiten van Krashna met donaties ondersteund. Hij wilde daar geen
    bedankjes voor. Hij nam overigens geen blad voor de mond, als hij op‐ of aanmerkingen had. Als
    weerwoord terecht was, accepteerde hij dat echter ook; de gulle en loyale mopperpot.

    Hij heeft vele concerten van Krashna bezocht, mede als recensent en later als liefhebber en erelid. Soms
    ging hij zelfs mee op tournee en genoot dan met volle teugen (Aken 2003: "Drie heerlijke dagen waren
    dat"). De laatste jaren werd hij helaas slechter ter been, waardoor hij niet alle concerten meer kon
    bezoeken. Het laatste concert van Krashna met Daan Admiraal heeft hij moeten missen. Dat deed hem veel
    verdriet; hij was erg op Daan gesteld en Daan stond als musicus bij Rien in hoog aanzien.

    Het eerste concert met Stijn Berkouwer, de opvolger van Daan, heeft hij wel kunnen bezoeken (Nederlands
    Programma). Hij was zeer verheugd over het resultaat en stak dat niet onder stoelen of banken. Dit was zijn
    laatste concertbezoek van koor‐ en orkest. De tourneeconcerten, de streams en het najaarsconcert 2021
    heeft hij moeten missen. Zijn laatste kamermuziekconcert was dat van november 2019, waar hij met veel
    plezier sinterklaasliedjes meezong.

    Ondergetekenden hebben na de zomer nog wat dingen voor Rien kunnen doen; 15 november hebben we
    hem nog gezien. We hadden de gedachte dat het mooi zou zijn als we hem vanuit Krashna zouden onthalen
    op concertjes bij hem thuis, waar hij een mooie vleugel had staan. Helaas hebben we het niet meer kunnen
    verwezenlijken. Het ging te snel. Op 23 november is Rien per ambulance naar een hospice gebracht en is
    daar op 24 november overleden. 1 december is hij in besloten kring gecremeerd.

    Yannick Hogers en Peter Polderman.

    The chamber orchestra of D.S.M.G. Krashna Musika was led by Ben Weishaupt in 2020. The orchestra will play parts from Bach's 1st orchestral suite and Haydn's 45th symphony (“Die Abschied-Sinfonie”). Moreover, four parts from a cycle by a famous composer are on the program, specially arranged for this concert by members of Krashna Musika.
    Due to corona, rehearsals and concerts had to be cancelled twice, but with some improvisation we managed to organize a covid19-safe rehearsal & recording day for a shortened program in September 2020. The recordings will be streamed on this page on Saturday 13 February at 21:00. We hope to see you then!
