  messiah-2018:
    title: Händel's Messiah
    description: |
      > “Hallelujah: for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.” (Revelation 19: 6)\
      > “The kingdom of this world is become the kingdom of our Lord, and of His Christ; and He shall reign for ever and ever.” (Revelation 11: 15)\
      > “King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.” (Revelation 19: 16)\
      > “Hallelujah!”

      *From “Hallelujah”, part 41 of the Messiah (source: [opera.stanford.edu](http://opera.stanford.edu))*

      **A delight to sing, and a delight to hear. This fall, Krashna will perform Georg Friedrich Händel’s most famous piece: the Messiah.**

      The very first performance of the Messiah was in Dublin, in 1742. Before earning his fame as an oratorio composer, Händel was committed to composing Italian opera. When he was already in his fifties in the 1730s the popularity of opera started to fade. As an alternative, Händel introduced English oratorios. His first were already a success: reportedly, undergraduates sold their furniture to afford the five-shilling tickets!

      In 1741, aged 55, Händel abandoned Italian opera for good. Shortly afterwards librettist Charles Jennens sent Händel a new libretto. Jennens wrote:

      > “I hope [Handel] will lay out his whole Genius & Skill upon it, that the Composition may excell all his former Compositions, as the Subject excells every other subject. The Subject is Messiah.”

      Apparently, Händel was promptly hit by a bout of pure inspiration, as he composed the entire three-part oratorio in only 24 days! His genius was quickly recognised: the oratorio was a great success and is still performed frequently to this day.

      In Christian theology, the Messiah is the saviour of the Jewish People, Jesus Christ. In Part I of Händel’s Messiah, the story of the birth of Christ is told. Part II is about Christ’s passion, death, resurrection and ascension, followed by the spreading of the gospel through the world. This spreading was summarised in Hallelujah: by far the most popular part of the Messiah. Part III – the final, shorter part – is then about the promise of redemption, a prediction of the day of judgement and finally the victory over sin and death.

      The Messiah is an impressive performance that every choir should be acquainted with. We at Krashna are very excited to perform it in one of the most beautiful churches of Delft: the Maria van Jessekerk! Come and enjoy this monumental piece with us this December!

  spring-amsterdam-2019:
    title: Tchaikovsky & Rachmaninov
    description: |
      **A haunting epic and a powerful display of virtuosity. Prepare to be blown away by the Krashna orchestra in March 2019 when we will play not one, but two works: the Manfred symphony by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and the second Piano Concerto by Sergei Rachmaninoff.**

      The Manfred symphony, a programmatic symphony, was composed by Tchaikovsky in 1885. Tchaikovsky was inspired by the Gothic poem of the same name, written by Lord Byron in 1817.

      In the poem, the main character Manfred is plagued by guilt about his deceased beloved Astarte. He travels to the Alps and summons seven spirits to help him forget his guilt. The spirits can not help him, and fate prevents him from escaping by suicide. In the end he appears in a bacchanal, meets the shade of Astarte and is pardoned. Manfred then dies free of guilt.

      The four parts of the symphony reflect the storyline of Manfred: the first part, *Lento lugubre*, is about Manfred’s wandering in the Alps, tormented by hopeless longings. This part features the loudest climax Tchaikovsky ever wrote. Then there is the *Vivace con spirito*, about the appearance of the Alpine spirit (probably no pun intended). With little definition of any harmonic base, this part sounds fragile and magical. After that the *Andante con moto* tells a story about the simple life of the mountain folk. Finally, the *Allegro con fuoco* ends the story with the bacchanal, pardoning and death of Manfred, featuring a fugue, unexpected twists and a beautiful Germanic chorale.

      Then there is Rachmaninoff’s second Piano Concerto, where Codarts conservatory student and TU Delft master student Floris van Dam shall play the solo piano part. It is one of Rachmaninoff’s most popular works. At its premiere in 1897, he just recovered from a depression that had lasted several years. From the first chords onwards, you can hear how his self-confidence was renewed.

      It has three parts, *Moderato*, *Adagio sostenuto* and *Allegro scherzando*. Throughout the entire piece it becomes apparent just how virtuosic Rachmaninoff was: the dazzling motives and enormous chords seem nearly impossible but combined with the orchestra create an impressively bombastic performance. An interesting fact: Rachmaninoff’s hands were very large, which is why he was able to play – and thus write – 13th intervals with one hand. That’s more than 30 cm!

      Two pieces full of drama, beauty and excitement. On the 9th of March, Krashna will perform this program in the Dominicuskerk in Amsterdam. Come enjoy a concert of Tchaikovsky’s and Rachmaninoff’s best pieces!

      On Saturday (!) the 19th of January (and not the 20th as was mistakenly mentioned at some sources), there will be another chamber music concert in the usual great hall of 'X' TU Delft (previously Unit Culture; Mekelweg 8-10, Delft).

      A special highlight of the program is going to be the 2nd movement of Rachmaninoff's famous 2nd piano concerto, arranged for a chamber music setting. Together with several smaller ensembles, it will make for a varied program.

      You are warmly invited to come and listen. The concert will start at 19:30, entrance is free.

      **Our neighbours have a rich musical history. Big names such as Bach and Brahms lived and worked in Germany on pieces that still impress us to this day. In June 2019, the choir and orchestra of Krashna Musika will honour a number of these composers, with three choir pieces by Bach, Mendelssohn and Rheinberger, and Schönberg’s orchestral adaptation of Brahms’s first piano quartet.**

      Johann Sebastian Bach (1685 – 1750) is the textbook example of a classic. He single-handedly defined the sound of German Baroque. Bach was a hard worker and composed so many pieces in his lifetime that a numbered catalogue of all his works was published in 1950: the “Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis”, or BWV, with numbers that reach far over a thousand. Krashna will perform BWV 118, a cantata named “O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht”: “Oh Jesus Christ, light of my life”.

      Josef Rheinberger (1839 – 1901) was born in Liechtenstein, but lived most of his life in Germany. When he was seven years old he was already the organist of the Vaduz parish church, an example of his extraordinary talent. “Stabat Mater” is a hymn to Maria that was written in the 13th century and has been put to music frequently since. The hymn portrays the suffering of Maria while her Son Jesus is crucified. In Rheinberger’s version, we can hear this harrowing story already from the first notes: “The sorrowful Mother stands weeping before the cross, while the Son hangs there.”

      Then Felix Mendelssohn (1809 – 1847), also a prodigy that stood at the start of the Romantic art period. Mendelssohn is amongst others known for his overture for “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”, his Italian and Scottish symphonies and even for the present day melody of the Christmas carol “Hark! The Herald Angels Sing”. Psalm 42 “Wie der Hirsch Schreit” (As pants the Hart) is, according to Mendelssohn himself, his best church music and consists of seven parts. Soprano Elise van Es will sing the soloist part.

      Finally, the orchestra will play an adaption of the first piano quartet by Johannes Brahms (1833 – 1897) by controversial composer Arnold Schönberg (1874 – 1951). While Brahms mostly stuck to a classical style, Schönberg stood at the front of the new Second Viennese School, where he presented his atonal and serial music. In 1934 he fled the Nazi regime and moved to the US, where he lived for the rest of his life. Schönberg wrote his adaptation of Brahms’s piano quartet in 1937. It contains many of his unusual ideas.

      Four works by German masters, performed by the student choir and orchestra of Krashna Musika. Come listen and discover the beauty of these pieces that, spread over the centuries, still retained their power. And stay a while for the unique encore!

      ## Delft's students present Dutch compositions

      **The Delft Student Music Association Krashna Musika gives a concert with the theme "Dutch Music". We will perform a varying program with pieces of Dutch composers, among others Van Gilse, Wagenaar and De Klerk. Besides, world première "In de Blauwe Nacht" by Reza Namavar will be played. This piece is specifically written for student orchestras, and Krashna is one of the twelve that will perform it.**

      The choir will take care of the program before the break and let hear three different works. "Caelestis Urbs Jerusalem" is composed by Alphons Diepenbrock, a componist who also joyed himself with writing and teaching. Completely autodidact, he has written several compositions, mostly with church music as inspiration.
      Daan Mannekes Psalm 122 will be sung. Manneke, born in Zeeland, was both a composer and organist. He has followed several music related studies and also taught himself at the Sweelinck Conservatorium Amsterdam. He claims Psalm 122 is a joyful piece that could also be described as "dance music".
      To conclude the first part of the concert, "Stabat Mater" by Albert de Klerk be performed, at which part of the orchestra and soloists Florieke Beelen and Arco Mandemaker will reinforce the choir.

      After the break, the orchestra will enter the stage and perform a very special piece. "In de Blauwe Nacht" is a composition written for Dutch Student music associations and will be performed twelve times (!) this fall. Reza Namavar, composer of this impressive music, says evolution is the central theme of his work.
      The orchestra will continue the program with the Ouverture of Cyrano de Bergerac, composed by Johan Wagenaar. Wagenaar was born in Utrecht and became organist of the famous Dome church in 1888. He has written many compositions during his life, in which one could distinctly recognize an authentic style.
      Jan van Gilse is the last composer. Born in Rotterdam, he went to Keulen for the conservatorium when he was only sixteen years old. During his study, he has written his First and Second symphony, of which we will play the second one.

      A beautiful and varying program, consisting of Dutch compositions, performed by Delfts students with a great passion for music. You definitely don’t want to miss this!

      The orchestra will continue the program with the Ouverture of Cyrano de Bergerac, composed by Johan Wagenaar. Wagenaar was born in Utrecht and became organist of the famous Dome church in 1888. He has written many compositions during his life, in which one could distinctly recognize an authentic style.
      Jan van Gilse is the last composer. Born in Rotterdam, he went to Keulen for the conservatorium when he was only sixteen years old. During his study, he has written his First and Second symphony, of which we will play the second one.

      A beautiful and varying program, consisting of Dutch compositions, performed by Delfts students with a great passion for music. You definitely don’t want to miss this!
