    title: Krashna Musika Reunion - 50 years!
    description: |
      As you might know, we’re celebrating our fiftieth birthday this year! For fifty years, we’ve been sharing our passion for music and in fifty years we’ve organized many great concerts.

      In these fifty years we’ve had lots of different members with lots of different stories. We’d like to collect these stories on Sunday the 6th of May by bringing together young and old, current and former Krashnese on the Krashna Musika Reunion day.

      Together with our current choir and orchestra conductors Ruben de Grauw and Daan Admiraal we’ll be rehearsing a variety of choir and orchestra pieces, which we’ll perform for each other at the end of the day.

      You’re also welcome to join the potluck-style dinner. Just bring a meal you like and together we’ll form a grand buffet.

      The general schedule will look like this:

      13:00-17:00 - Rehearsals\
      17:00-18:30 - Dinner\
      18:30-20:00 - Performances

      Hopefully, we’ll meet you on Sunday the 6th of May! You can sign up by filling in [this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSegXi1GOXB4JtOG4eMGzti4iHOsaokux-uTcRXxlIP8FppcCg/viewform?usp=sf_link).

    title: Heroes and Trains - Chamber Music Concert
    description: |
      Last Sunday, 31 March, we had another chamber music concert! The audience could enjoy lovely music throughout the evening, varying from a string quartet to a full chamber choir. The concert was even more interesting than usual this time, because we got to hear several original compositions, by Krashnese! For example, a composition was performed by a string quartet, in which the story of a hero came to life. Another original piece (for chamber orchestra), originally written to give percussionists more interesting parts than usual in most pieces, also made a strong impression.

      Another group of musicians performed two impressive graduation pieces, with a solo cellist. The fingers flew rapidly over the strings and brought beautiful sounds to life. One of these was a piece by Villa-Lobos, imitating a train on its journey, with astonishing similarity. Another one was composed by Gulda and crossed fluently between classical and rock genres.

      Overall, it was a very nice evening. We are looking forward to the next chamber music concert, which will taken place on the 12th of May at 3pm, in the Lutherse Kerk in Delft. The day before, a masterclass will take place, at which the ensembles will be coached by professional chamber musicians. We're looking forward to this weekend full of music!

The masterclasses, which will take place between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m., are free to visit and will take place at the Sports and Culture building at the campus of the TU Delft (X, Mekelweg 8-10).

      The next day (Sunday May 12th), the ensembles will perform their pieces during the Chamber Music Concert. There will be a wide variety of repertoire, from pieces composed by Schubert and Ravel, to a piece of Billy Joel. The concert, which will start at 3 p.m., will be performed at the Lutherse Kerk in Delft and is also free to visit. It promises to be a lovely afternoon!

      Can't make it on Sunday, but still want to hear the program? That’s possible! Saturday May 11th (at 7:00 p.m.) we will give a free try-out at the theatre hall of the Sports and Culture building. Come and listen!

      We’ve got a new concert master! Esther Meershoek, an experienced violinist and already a member at Krashna for some time, took over from her predecessor Nina Zuure on 1 September. It’s up to Esther now to lead and guide the orchestra to future concerts. Her first performance will be our Dutch project, featuring several pieces by Dutch composers. The concerts will take place on Friday 20 and Saturday 21 December. Save the dates, because you don’t want to miss Esther’s debut as concert master!

    title: A Special Chamber Music Concert
    description: |
      Last Sunday we had a special chamber music night, as an ending to the New Members Day.

      After all the new members, that just joined Krashna for their first year, completed a scavenger hunt through Delft, they got a chance to showcase their talents before an audience! Of course, they were informed of this just before the concert, so the results were very entertaining.

      Apart from the new members, also some existing members of Krashna performed some impressive pieces, such as a ballad by Chopin, a virtuosic cello duet and a string quartet by the great great uncle of our cellist Dieuwke Smit-Sibinga, who played the cello part herself.
